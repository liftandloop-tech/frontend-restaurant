Hey, build this UI from the image I’ll provide using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Make the code clean, modern, and fully responsive for all screen sizes. The main working file is [Main-file-name], and all components should go inside src/components/[foldername]. Each UI part must be a reusable functional component with proper props and clear structure. Add short comments explaining important sections of the code. Use Tailwind classes only (no inline styles). Include smooth hover effects, transitions, and proper spacing to match the design perfectly. Follow a neat folder structure and naming convention. Make sure the final code runs without any single error, warning, or bug. At the end, show me the folder layout and then provide the complete, working code for every file. The final UI should look pixel-perfect and ready for production. and apply the basic working in the page / components
